<p>A panda loved sleeping all day and lounging in the sun. It enjoyed eating bamboo and taking long naps. The forest animals often teased the panda for being lazy. However, the panda was content and carefree.</p>

<p>One day, food became scarce, and the forest animals needed help. The lazy panda realized it had to contribute. It joined in collecting bamboo and sharing it with friends. Slowly, the panda became more active and helpful.</p>

<p>The other animals admired the panda’s change. They realized even the laziest creatures can make a difference. The panda learned that small efforts can help the community. It became a valued member of the forest family.</p>
